## Live Demo

## Indications

[Install SASS using this guide](https://sass-lang.com/install)  
Once you are set run this command in the console from the root of this project:  
`sass --watch assets/sass/main-sass.scss:assets/css/style.css`  

Your output file named styles.css will reside on /assets/css.  
You can check or edit all the partials and the main-sass.scss in the /assets/sass/.
